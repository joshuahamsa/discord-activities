## Discord Developers 

 The Of!cial Discord Developers server is a developer ran, but community driven, support hub. If you need help with developing something on Discord or want of!cial updates from the developers, this is the place to be.

## Libraries 

 Discord does not maintain of!cial SDKs. The following table is an inexhaustive list of third-party libraries that have valid rate limit implementations, are recently maintained, and have large communities of active bots.

## Interactions 

Interactions are the great, new way of making a Discord bot. The following open-source libraries provide help for the security and authentication checks that are mandatory if you are receiving Interactions via outgoing webhook. They also include some types for the Interactions data models. C#

## OpenAPI Speci!cation 

The OpenAPI spec is currently in public preview and **is subject to breaking changes** The public preview of the Discord HTTP API speci!cation provides a standard OpenAPI 3.1 spec for the HTTP API. 

## Permission Calculators 

Permissions in Discord are tricky. Luckily, we've got really smart people who love us and have made some great permissions calculators. If you're making a bot for others, and you're not sure how to properly calculate permissions or generate your authorization URL, these are great tools: BotForge's Permissions Calculator FiniteReality's Permissions Calculator

## Intent Calculators 

Gateway Intents are pretty confusing at !rst. If you're not sure what to send in your Identify payload, then these tools may be of help: ziad87's Intent Calculator Larko's Intent Calculator 

## Embed Visualizers 

Webhooks and embeds might seem like black magic. That's because they are, but let us help you demystify them a bit. These tools can help you test how embeds will appear inside of Discord: JohnyTheCarrot's Embed Previewer (Browser Extension) 

## API Types 


If you're working on a project that interacts with our API, you might !nd an API types module useful as it provides type inspection/completion for the Discord API. **NAME LANGUAGE** dasgo Go discord-api-types JavaScript 

## Game SDK Tools 

Discord Game SDK's lobby and networking layer shares similarities with other gaming platforms (i.e. Valve's Steamworks SDK). The following open source library provides developers a uniform interface for these shared features and can simplify developing for multiple platforms. Note: this library is tailored for Unity3D development. HouraiNetworking
